# find_and_rename_files

Using create_files.sh script you can automatically create folders/subfilders and files inside them from the list that is defined in folders.txt and files.txt

Then, using script find_and_rename.sh, you can rename the created files. As an example, files created here are project_resource[N]_dev.yaml, where N represents a Number, and then are renamed to project_resource[N]_prod.yaml.
By editing folders.txt, files.txt and the find_and_rename.sh script, you can adopt the script to your liking.
